# Overview

This application is a demonstation of the skills I have aquired in the Kotlin language as well as working with JSON files.

This software is a basic weather application that allows you to input a city and receive the current weather as well as a five day forecast.

This software was written as a learning tool for me to learn the Kotlin language as well as to learn working with different APIs.
